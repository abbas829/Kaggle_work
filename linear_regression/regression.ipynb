    "\n",
    "1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – We visualized data distributions, found strong relationships between features, and identified that the California Housing dataset is clean with no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing** – We capped outliers and standardized features to ensure they're on the same scale, which improves model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assumption Checking** – We verified that our data reasonably meets linear regression assumptions (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Training & Evaluation** – We trained multiple models and found that ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) typically outperform simple linear regression on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Residual Diagnostics** – Analyzing residuals confirmed that our model's predictions have reasonable error patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Feature Importance** – We identified that location-based features (Latitude, Longitude) and median income are key drivers of house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Checklist for Future Projects:\n",
    "✓ Always explore your data first with visualizations  \n",
    "✓ Check for and handle missing values and outliers  \n",
    "✓ Verify regression assumptions before drawing conclusions  \n",
    "✓ Scale features to comparable ranges  \n",
    "✓ Split data into train-test sets for honest evaluation  \n",
    "✓ Compare multiple models instead of assuming one is best  \n",
    "✓ Analyze residuals to validate model assumptions  \n",
    "✓ Interpret feature importance to understand your model  \n",
