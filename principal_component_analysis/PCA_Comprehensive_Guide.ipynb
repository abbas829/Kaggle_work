    "# Like finding the optimal camera angles, one by one\n",
    "# Result: PC2, PC3, ... PC30—each uncorrelated with the others\n",

    "\n",
    "While textbooks teach eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix, modern implementations (including scikit-learn) use **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** for superior numerical stability.\n",

    "$$X = U \\Sigma V^T$$\n",

    "✅ MUST DO:\n",
    "   ☐ Standardize all features (zero mean, unit variance) — ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL!\n",
    "   ☐ Handle missing values appropriately\n",
    "   ☐ Analyze explained variance—decide on K before transforming\n",
    "   ☐ Benchmark your model with and without PCA\n",
    "   ☐ Fit PCA on training data ONLY; transform test data separately\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ NEVER DO:\n",
    "   ☐ Apply PCA to raw, unscaled data\n",
    "   ☐ Fit PCA on the full dataset (includes test data—causes data leakage!)\n",
    "   ☐ Use PCA when interpretability of original features is paramount\n",
    "   ☐ Expect PCA to improve accuracy (it often doesn't—it trades speed for accuracy)\n",
    "   ☐ Apply to purely categorical data without proper encoding\n",
